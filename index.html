    <h1>Team [XiS]</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>The Start</h2>
      Soulrain (known as renegade at the time) played for both uSa and WOLF, as a camping sniper.  This Unreal Tournament 99 mod allowed translocators, and a custom sniper rifle only.  The sniper rifle was only accurate while croching or standing still.  Headshots were insta-kills, otherwise 3 shots to the body did 100 damage.  As an upcoming talent, Soulrain pushed the boundries of the mod, creating his own hybrid style, known as freestyle.  
      <br /><br />
        In freestyle you did not have to hide or limit your movement.  Aggression was key, but keeping in mind someone crouching has the advantage.  Due to the 115 game speed, the "freestyle" plays caught many off gaurd.  Soulrain eventually left, creating his own team: BTU, aka Better Than U.
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>The Early Days</h2>
      After creating the team, it soon fell apart.  Two members were caught cheating, and reputation was ruined.  It was later reformed under the name XiS aka Xtremely Insane Snipers.  With the problems behind them, Soulrain slowly started to attract tallent from all over.  Promising young talent (as young as 13) joined, as they wanted to be part of this new game type, on a team with a reputation that was building up to be the best anyone had ever seen.
      <br /><br />
      Soulrains friends Chris and Andrew were some of the earliest members, but they eventually left for the only other "pure" freestyle team to exist: {Fu2}.  Early on team like FBI (the best at the time), DoC (a Euro sniper team), and a few others like OMA were known for a more agressive playstyle, but not quite freestyle.
      <br /><br />
      "Rumbles", aka scrims were setup by Soulrain, which ended up attracting more talent.  As most teams only had a few good players, usually 1 at most, they would often find themselves to soon be part of XiS.  Shifted and P-lo joined, eventually becoming co-leaders.  Chris aka Gangsta, would leave for unknown reasons, joining {Fu2}.  Noteable members Fish_n_chips joined, alongside Bear.  And about a year later, the 3rd co-leader was recruited on the FBI server by P-lo, Oofki.  This pattern would continue for sometime, Soulrain was known for "stealing" talent.  A few years later this would happen internationally as well, as Hawky and Stash would join from the UK.
      <br /><br />
      At this point, the team had never lost a rumble.  Hacking accusations were taking place, and the playstyle was being criticized.  As a result, a few "pure" camping teams were created, some very strict about how much you can move, with the most extreme being known as WarPigs.  The starting lineups became more logical, based on who perfomed the best previously, essentially an interal ranking system was created.  And other teams were starting to get upset.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Wolf Tournaments</h2>
      Wolf, being known as one of the largest and most stable camping clans hosted a tournament, being the first of its kind.  XiS did enter, and found themselves the first season winners.  This is when Stash aka Ash, was found, playing for a European team, his talent stood out, and he joined XiS after a few weeks.
      <br /><br />
      The next season XiS joined again, but about half way through, the tournament was canceled.  Vern, the owner of Wolf often found conflict with XiS, and the tournament was stopped because of it.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>New "Freestylers"</h2>
      Many, many, many teams were created to try and compete with XiS's style.  {fu2} was no longer relevant, as they had known cheaters, so other teams tried to step up.  None of them were even close to successful, but new types of "freestyle" were created.  American teams made 200 (max) speed servers that were more like zark, and refused to admit they re-branded an existing mod.  European teams, most noteably DoC created a "bunny style" freestyle, where you could crouch and shoot accurately, even when in mid-air.  XiS was disinterested with these variants because they moved away from the core philosophy of the camping mod, and binds to crouch and shoot were often set as mouse 1, removing the skill ceiling from the game.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Fragged Nation</h2>
      An independent ladder system was created and shortly after UT was added, the sniper community created a 5v5 camping tournament. XiS again won the first season.  And once again, there was more conflict with XiS.  In a match with XiS vs ESG, ESG found a few kills then hid under water falls, where you cannot access unless you "run and gun" to kill them, which was prohibited.  XiS still managed to win, but the rules had to change.
      <br /> <br />
      Due to the previous season the rules were changed a bit, the last few minutes you were able to "run and gun".  Even when XiS found themselves behind, they would easily catch up during these times.  They again won the season, without taking any losses.  Still undefeated.
      <br /> <br />
      Some of the members were known in other communities already (noteablely Fish and Bear in SA and IG, and CC for BT), but they would branch out more.  A subset of the team created LoZ or lords of zark, entering the zark tournaments well.  It was short lived, but XiS aka LoZ left the scene being known as the second best zark team.
      <br /> <br />
      There was one more season of FN that XiS participated in, winning again.  By this time, the corruption that was allowed was too much.  A member of another team was a community manager, would constantly harass XiS.  And as part of this season, special mods were created to attempt to "nerf" XiS, moving would make you take damage, dodging was disabled, and so on.  The repeated attempts to remove XiS had failed, as XiS was friends with another community manager, Steel, who was part of the number 1 zark team.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Cheating and the PSA</h2>
      Before the 4th season of FN, Oofki was playing with Fish and found some free cheats.  He tried them on unrelated servers (other mods) and they thought it was funny for a few hours, until joining a server where they were detected.  The owner of the server happened to be a mod for FN as well, so the news made it's way to the ladder, and eventually the sniper community.
      <br /> <br />
      Started by a clan XiS had never interacted with before or played against, lead the charge, creating a PSA.  This PSA, signed by other teams such as Wolf, made it's rounds, demanding XiS be banned from everything.  For years most of the community had suspected XiS of cheating, so they struck when the iron was hot.  XiS was banned from FN, but not much else changed after that.  The cheat itself was a menu mod type cheat, so it cannot block UTDC screenshots.  If Oofki had cheated in the past, he for sure would have been caught.  Oofki was even allowed to play on most servers after, though, XiS as a whole was banned from a few.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Final Chapter (Kind Of)</h2>
      XiS continued to play, and never lost a single rumble, match, or tournament.  Inner turmoil eventually lead to the team splitting.  Oofki created h4 and a new server, with a new rifle that became the standard for freestyle play.  XiS crumbled.  Eventually it was re-created as s2n, with Soulrain, Demigod, and a few other 2nd and 3rd string previous members.  P-lo went on to FBI, while the h4 team took with it Fish, their star player.  The h4 server was very active, unlike the s2n one, and with everyone playing closely with Fish, the skil of each team quickly difted apart, making the starting line up of h4 the strongest team the sniper community had ever seen.  
      <br /> <br />
      Demigod and Remix became the rising stars alongside Soulrain for s2n, but it wasn't enough to compete against h4 or the rest of the sniper community.  Oofki became known as the best sniper to ever play, even above Fish and Bear, who had dominated the scene for years.  Demi and Remix were widely accepted as taking the next spots, respectively making them 4th and 5th, pushing Soulrain to 6th best ranked player of all time.
      <br /> <br />
      After a year or so, these teams eventually dissolved as the scene died, without competition.  s2n and h4 were mostly barred from the community events.  But... as the previously mentioned corrupt FN mod was removed, there was one more time they played.  FN had a "fun night", where Soulrain, Fish, Oofki, Bear, and few others joined.  The whole thing was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-D1eVhdM14">recorded and put on youtube</a>.  XiS played, getting monster kill after monster kill on an IG type game mode, and then zark-variant, until everyone got so frustrated they left.
      <br /> <br /> 
      Years later, a few XiS still play on weekends, but it's mostly gone too.  The 30 year old men who used to harass the 13-15 year olds finally won.  It just took them 15 years to get their way.  They spread lies, created PSAs, secret groups, nothing stopped them, until in the end... themselves.
