    <h1>Team [XiS]</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>The Start</h2>
      Soulrain (known as renegade at the time) played for both uSa and WOLF, as a camping sniper.  This Unreal Tournament 99 mod allowed translocators, and a custom sniper rifle only.  The sniper rifle was only accurate while croching or standing still.  Headshots were insta-kills, otherwise 3 shots to the body did 100 damage.  As an upcoming talent, Soulrain pushed the boundries of the mod, creating his own hybrid style, known as freestyle.  
      <br />
        In freestyle you did not have to hide or limit your movement.  Aggression was key, but keeping in mind someone crouching has the advantage.  Due to the 115 game speed, the "freestyle" plays caught many off gaurd.  Soulrain eventually left, creating his own team: BTU, aka Better Than U.

    <h2>The Early Days</h2>
      After creating the team, it soon fell apart.  Two members were caught cheating, and reputation was ruined.  It was later reformed under the name XiS aka Xtremely Insane Snipers.  With the problems behind them, Soulrain slowly started to attract tallent from all over.  Promising young talent (as young as 13) joined, as they wanted to be part of this new game type, on a team with a reputation that was building up to be the best anyone had ever seen.
      <br />
      Soulrains friends Chris and Andrew were some of the earliest members, but they eventually left for the only other "pure" freestyle team to exist: {Fu2}.  Early on team like FBI (the best at the time), DoC (a Euro sniper team), and a few others like OMA were known for a more agressive playstyle, but not quite freestyle.
      <br />
      "Rumbles", aka scrims were setup by Soulrain, which ended up attracting more talent.  As most teams only had a few good players, usually 1 at most, they would often find themselves to soon be part of XiS.  Shifted and P-lo joined, eventually becoming co-leaders.  Chris aka Gangsta, would leave for unknown reasons, joining {Fu2}.  Noteable members Fish_n_chips joined, alongside Bear.  And about a year later, the 3rd co-leader was recruited on the FBI server by P-lo, Oofki.  This pattern would continue for sometime, Soulrain was known for "stealing" talent.  A few years later this would happen internationally as well, as Hawky and Stash would join from the UK.
      <br />
      At this point, the team had never lost a rumble.  Hacking accusations were taking place, and the playstyle was being criticized.  As a result, a few "pure" camping teams were created, some very strict about how much you can move, with the most extreme being known as WarPigs.  The starting lineups became more logical, based on who perfomed the best previously, essentially an interal ranking system was created.  And other teams were starting to get upset.
